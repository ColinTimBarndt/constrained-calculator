# Constrained Calculator

This is a domain specific calculator and framework using a constraint
solver for recomputing values while fields are being changed.
Itt was made to help myself with component selection for electronics
projects, however it can be used for many other things as well.

The code isn't well documented at the moment and the HTML isn't the
most beautiful because I made this within two days. No frameworks
were used, this is just plain HTML + CSS + Typescript.
